Project Title: Tracking Effectiveness of Police Reform

## Theme

> In this checkpoint, we interact with the misconducts occurring over the years and investigate why reforms identified in previous checkpoints are failing.

## Summary of Checkpoint 3 

> In this checkpoint, the questions we are going to delve into:
- What misdemeanours were prevalent in each year and do they decrease or increase? Study the trend and reform affected in further detail following the previous checkpoint. We can do this by using a bar chart race to illustrate the leading complaint category trends up till 2018. 
- Why are targeted reforms failing? Are these reforms as targeted as they claim to be?  For this we can use circle packaging visualization to view the misconducts and the sub categories within it.
