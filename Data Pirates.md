## Citizens Police Database Project 

## Theme

The theme of this project is assessing and tracking police reform to check if there are natural improvements or if they are instances of under-reporting. Research into tracking police reform is essential in knowing whether substantial improvements are being made across the board, identifying neighborhoods that might require additional supervi- sion/intervention, and checking for under-reporting cases, and increase vigilance in these areas accordingly.
Our goal is to leverage the information available on types of complaints made by both civilians and officers alike against police officers, based on neighborhood demographics, complaint outcomes,the extent of disciplining, and information on subsequent investigation to gain insight on if and how accountability is being enforced.

## Checkpoint 1 - SQL Analytics

> In this checkpoint, we establish grounds to evaluate accountability measures taken by the CPD concerning investiga- tions and legal actions. This will allow us to gain an understanding of how resources allocated for reform are utilized and whether there is transparency in accountability measures.

- What were the top three complaints in each neighborhood in Chicago, who were the officers that were involved in those cases, and how much money was spent on legal fees?
- For each repeating officer, what was the type of complaint filed, the disciplinary action taken, the demographic information of the victims, and where was the investigator from (COPA or police department)?
- What type of complaint was most investigated, were the officers involved disciplined, and what was the average number of investigations that were sustained and the average time of investigation taken per investigator?
- Within a police beat, what is the percentage of complaints made by officers, and what is the number of repeaters?

## Checkpoint 2 - Data Exploration

> In this checkpoint, we hope to infer whether resources allocated to reforming police are utilized judiciously and if accountability is being enforced or is used to enable problematic behavior.

- How much legal fee is being spent on an average for each type of complaint: are they settling with the victims or reprimanding, or both?
- In each neighborhood, out of all the complaints, how many were disciplined per type of complaint?

## Interactive Visualisation 

> With interactive visualisation, we would like to interact with the complaints, disciplinary action and legal expenditure data over the years to understand how accountability is being relayed in each neighbourhood in the form of heat maps, line graphs, etc.

## Checkpoint 4 - Graph Analytics

> Based on officer demographics and population demographics, lawsuit money, and complaint count trends we can predict the complaint count and legal fees for the next year which can allow us to check if reform has happened or if there has been severe under-reporting.
An unnatural decrease in legal expenditure and complaint count of officers and victim complaints alike will indicate instances of under-reporting and a hostile work environment.

## Checkpoint 5 - Natural Language Processing

> In this checkpoint, we hope to explore the complaint Reports using sentiment analysis to add to the observations of neighborhood demographics to gain insight on whether there is a bias toward certain social-economic groups or races, and if reform should be targeted towards specific officers or precincts in the neighborhood, in general, require reformative training as a whole.
