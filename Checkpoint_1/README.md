Project Title: Tracking Effectiveness of Police Reform

## Theme 

Is police reform effective? We are assessing and tracking police reform to check if there are improvements after reformative interventions like the COPA. If Police reform has been effective, there should be an observable yet gradual decrease in counts of misconduct and changes in officer behavior and accountability patterns. Research into tracking police reform is essential in knowing whether substantial improvements are being made across the board, identifying neighborhoods that might require additional supervision/intervention, and checking for under-reporting of cases, and increasing vigilance in these areas accordingly.

Our goal is to leverage the information available on types of complaints made by both civilians and officers alike against police officers, based on neighborhood, complaint outcomes, the extent of disciplining, and information on subsequent investigation to gain insight on if and how accountability is being enforced.


## Summary of Checkpoint 1

In this checkpoint we explore the accountability measures taken by the CPD concerning investigations. This allows us to gain an understanding of how effective COPA has been since its advent and also observe patterns in disciplinary actions.

The questions that we ask and answer in this Checkpoint are:

- What are the top 3 complaints in each neighborhood before COPA?

- What are the top 3 complaints in each neighbourhood after COPA?

- For all officers that had sustained allegations, what were the disciplinary actions taken?

- For each type of allegation, how many were sustained before COPA and after COPA?

The findings are outlined in findings.pdf and all the results and details are available on Github.

## How to Run Queries 

From /src, run checkpoint1.sql from DataGrip while connected to the CPDB database.

Comments are provided along with the queries. In general the entire sql file can be run, in sequence to produce our final outputs. We suggest stepping through the queries in each question to analyze our motive and help verify our results.
