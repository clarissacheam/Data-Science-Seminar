# Data Pirates

By: Kavya Jaganathan, Clarissa Cheam and Ayushi Mishra

Project Title: Tracking Effectiveness of Police Reform

## Theme

> In this checkpoint we explore the text content available in the tables data_attachmentnarrative and data_allegation. We study both these tables since data_attachmentnarrative table's text content gives an account of the allegation, along with the victim perspective in terms of words uttered by the accused to them, tone/demeanor of accused that they observed, etc. whereas the data_allegation table's text content gives a report written by an officer without much of the victim's direct words.

## Summary of Checkpoint 5 
The question we hope to answer:

- What was the sentiment in the CPDB complaint data pre major reforms ( before 2016 ) and post major reforms?

## How to view code:
The code can be run from this notebook here:

There is a static snapshot of the colab notebook in src as a .ipynb file.

The analysis is embedded in the notebook as well as found in Findings.pdf. Since there are interactive graphs present, we suggest reading the analysis from the notebook.
