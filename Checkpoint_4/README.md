Project Title: Tracking Effectiveness of Police Reform

## Theme 

Is police reform effective? We are assessing and tracking police reform to check if there are improvements after reformative interventions like the COPA. If Police reform has been effective, there should be an observable yet gradual decrease in counts of misconduct and changes in officer behavior and accountability patterns. Research into tracking police reform is essential in knowing whether substantial improvements are being made across the board, identifying neighborhoods that might require additional supervision/intervention, and checking for under-reporting of cases, and increasing vigilance in these areas accordingly.

Our goal is to leverage the information available on types of complaints made by both civilians and officers alike against police officers, based on neighborhood, complaint outcomes, the extent of disciplining, and information on subsequent investigation to gain insight on if and how accountability is being enforced.


## Summary of Checkpoint 4

In this checkpoint, we test the hypothesis, "Are certain officers the cause of high misconduct counts in a certain district, or is it a unit-wide issue? If so, how does this affect reform choices". We test this hypothesis to investigate whether reform needs to be implemented unit-wide or would retraining/removing certain officers improve the situation. To this end we will be interacting with officer nodes, unit_ids and coaccusal counts. This checkpoint will further expand our focus from “Tracking police reform” to “Tracking and Nudging Police reform towards efficiency”.

- What is the distribution of allegation counts and trr counts in units? Is the distribution uniformly distributed indicating a unit wide problem or is the distribution skewed showing presence of certain problematic officers?

- If certain officers are the problem in their respective units we want to magnify this network and investigate which officers are the ring leaders, and at the center of co-accusals, influencing other officers?
